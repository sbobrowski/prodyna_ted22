/*
 	- Create classes like in Java with "class FooBar" (public ist default and not needed)
 	- Each class can have one primary and 0-x secondary constructors
 	- Full Syntax is: "class FooBar(var attribute1: String, var attribute2: Long)"
 	- Secondary constructors are using the keyword "constructor", keyword can omitted at primary if no annotation is used
 	- data classes are using keyword "data" before "class" and need a primary constructor
	- class attributes as usual with "var/val fooBar: String = "Initial Value"!
 	- no getters / setters needed
 	- customized getters setters possible:
